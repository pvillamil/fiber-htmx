# Updating the repo thumbnails

__Each screenshot is `3.7mb`__. That's too much for a repo thumbnail. We can reduce the size down to `150kb` by
following these steps:
1. Take a screenshot of each light variation using [GoFullPage Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl)
2. Combine both images side by side using [ImgOnline](https://www.imgonline.com.ua/eng/combine-two-images-into-one.php)
3. Crop the image using [ILoveImg](https://www.iloveimg.com/crop-image)
4. Resize the image by 50% using [ILoveImg](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image)
5. Compress the image using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
6. Copy the image to `.github/assets/home-page.md`
